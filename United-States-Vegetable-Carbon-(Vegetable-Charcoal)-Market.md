Furthermore, the growing popularity of plant-based food alternatives also fuels the use of vegetable charcoal in a variety of culinary applications. <p><strong>Cosmetics:</strong> In the cosmetics industry, vegetable carbon serves a dual purpose of both coloring and cleansing, and it has become a key ingredient in several beauty products. Charcoal-infused products, such as face masks, soaps, shampoos, and toothpaste, are immensely popular due to their ability to absorb impurities and toxins from the skin.
